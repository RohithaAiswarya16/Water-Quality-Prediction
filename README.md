## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-quality-prediction.git
   cd water-quality-prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data and run experiments:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `Water_Quality_Prediction (1).ipynb` or `Water Quality Predictor.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps to perform data analysis and model training.
